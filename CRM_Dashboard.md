Project Brief

You work as a Sales Manager for Millennials Tech, a company that specializes in selling computer hardware to large businesses. They’ve just started using a new CRM system to track their sales opportunities but have no visibility of the data outside of the platform. To combat this, you’ve set out to build an interactive dashboard that enables sales managers like yourself to track their team's quarterly performance. 
Along the way, you’ll :
1️⃣ Prepare the data for analysis 
2️⃣ Explore the data with pivot tables
3️⃣ Build a dynamic dashboard 

Objective 1 - PREPARE DATA

PREPARE THE DATA FOR ANALYSIS :

Open the sales_pipeline.csv file in Google sheets.
Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the data. How many opportunities has been won , over what period of time ? What products were sold ? Are there any missing values?
Open the sales_teams.csv file in new tab
Bring the manager and regional_office for each sales_agent in the sales_pipeline table.



STEPS TAKEN :
	1. Import CSV files.
	2. Check Column Stats for each column.
	3. Understood the data.
	4. Use Xlookup to bring the manager and regional_office for each sales_agent in the sales_pipeline table.
	5. Use Absolute and relative cell references in Xlookup formula.


Objective 2 - EXPLORE DATA

EXPLORE THE DATA WITH PIVOT TABLES

Insert a pivot table on a new tab to show opportunities won by quarter.
Add another pivot table on same sheet to break down the percentage of won & lost opportunities by quarter.
Create  a final Pivot table to show the opportunities won by quarter for each sales agent, and sort  the sales agents in descending order by opportunities won.
Restructure the first two pivot tables so that they have the quarters as pivot table columns(not rows), and sort them so the most recent quarter always comes first.

STEPS TAKEN :
	1. Insert Pivot table . Select values , rows and columns as per objective.
	2. Created separate table to show Lost and Won opportunities and converted into percentage to show how many percent are won and how many lost.
	3. Arrange pivot tables in descending order to show latest dates first.
